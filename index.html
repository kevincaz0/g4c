    <h1>G4C Embedded Game</h1>
    <p> Our game is called "Hide Or Fight", and the idea for this game came from a problem that many people face every day, which is feeling unsafe outside. Many people feel unsafe when traveling alone outside, as there have been many instances where people have been attacked just from walking outside. And we made this game to represent that. In this game, we created characters that you play as that represent normal people, and two enemies that represent the attackers. The action of the game starts out by your character, which is an innocent person, being attacked. You must defeat the enemy in order to advance to the next sequence. In the next scene, you encounter another enemy who seems like a really polite and gentle person when you see them, but then after you talk to them you realize that they are also an enemy. This conveys the lesson that you should not trust anyone, especially if you do not know them. Overall, the purpose of this game is to bring awareness to the problem of people feeling unsafe being outside and the amount of fear we have to experience every day. </p>
